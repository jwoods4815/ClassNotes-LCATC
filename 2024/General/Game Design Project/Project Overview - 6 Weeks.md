### **6-Week Platformer Game Design Course**  
**Theme:** *Design, prototype, and refine a 2D platformer using Schell’s lenses.*  

#### **Week 1: Foundations & Concept**  
**Goal:** Define your game’s core idea and player experience.  
- **Read:** Intro + Ch. 1–3 (Designer’s Role, Iteration) + Ch. 5 (Lens of Fun).  
- **Key Lenses:** Fun, Player, Curiosity.  
- **Deliverable:**  
  - 1-page concept doc (use the [Markdown template](https://chat.openai.com/c/9a9b5f3f-6f1a-4e2d-9e3a-1c1b9f3e3d3a) from earlier).  
  - Paper prototype of movement/core mechanic.  

#### **Week 2: Mechanics & Controls**  
**Goal:** Polish core mechanics (jumping, movement, interactions).  
- **Read:** Ch. 8 (Mechanics), Ch. 10 (Balance), Ch. 12 (Puzzles).  
- **Key Lenses:** Challenge, Flow, Feedback.  
- **Deliverable:**  
  - Digital prototype (e.g., Unity/Godot/PICO-8) with:  
    - Basic controls (move/jump).  
    - 1 test level (platforms + 1 obstacle).  
  - Playtest report (3+ players).  

#### **Week 3: Level Design & Progression**  
**Goal:** Design levels that teach and challenge players.  
- **Read:** Ch. 13 (Lens of Skill), Ch. 15 (Lens of Reward).  
- **Key Lenses:** Skill, Reward, Punishment.  
- **Deliverable:**  
  - 3-tier level (easy → medium → hard).  
  - Diagram of difficulty curve (annotate with lenses).  

#### **Week 4: Aesthetics & Feel**  
**Goal:** Enhance immersion with art, sound, and juice.  
- **Read:** Ch. 20 (Beauty), Ch. 22 (Lens of Accessibility).  
- **Key Lenses:** Beauty, Accessibility, Emotion.  
- **Deliverable:**  
  - Mood board (art/sound references).  
  - "Juiced" prototype (e.g., screen shake, particle effects).  

#### **Week 5: Playtesting & Iteration**  
**Goal:** Refine based on feedback.  
- **Read:** Ch. 25 (Lens of Feedback), Ch. 30 (Lens of the Market).  
- **Key Lenses:** Feedback, Transparency, Replayability.  
- **Deliverable:**  
  - Iterated prototype (fix 3 major issues from playtests).  
  - 2-min video demo (showcase improvements).  

#### **Week 6: Presentation & Reflection**  
**Goal:** Showcase your game and reflect on the process.  
- **Prepare:**  
  - 5-min presentation (show prototype + lens-driven decisions).  
  - 1-page reflection: *"How did the lenses improve our design?"*
