### **Platformer Game Design Project**  
**Prompt:**  
*"Design and develop a unique 2D platformer game inspired by classics like:*  
- **Celeste** (tight controls, progressive difficulty)  
- **Hollow Knight** (exploration, atmosphere)  
- **Super Mario Bros.** (accessible, mechanic-driven levels)  

**Requirements:**  
1. **Playable Prototype**:  
   - Core mechanics (e.g., jump, dash, climb) + at least 3 levels.  
   - *Bonus:* Add a unique twist (e.g., time reversal, grappling hooks).  
2. **5-Minute Presentation**:  
   - Showcase gameplay + explain 3 key design choices using *Schell’s lenses*.  
3. **Daily Logs**:  
   - Each member submits a **1-paragraph summary per work session** (e.g., *“Implemented double-jump; tested with Lens of Flow”*).  

**Grading Focus:**  
- Creativity (20%) | Functionality (30%) | Lenses Applied (20%) | Documentation (30%).  

**Suggested Additions:**  
- **Team Roles**: Assign tasks (e.g., programmer, artist, documenter) to ensure accountability.  
- **Playtest Report**: Include feedback from 3+ peers.
